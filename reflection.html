          Responsive design is to create websites which can adjust and looks
          good on the devices that they are currently viewed on. In todayâ€™s
          world, internet is one of the most powerful forms of media. The
          sharing of internet using desktops, mobile devices, tablets is growing
          rapidly. So, it is compulsory to make a website or any application
          that works on any devices and satisfy the client needs. In particular,
          web technology is in a full need of responsive web designs. People
          using mobile devices may feel less comfortable in using the web
          application which are designed for desktop computers. So, the new
          frameworks like React, Angular, Vue will be helpful to make the
          upcoming or old websites fully responsive by making many changes.
          <br />
          With the responsive design, the content of website will be same in all
          devices but the flexibility, alignment, screen size will be different
          according to the resolution, size of the devices. In simple terms, the
          horizontal view in desktop browser will becomes vertical view with
          scroll bar in mobile or tablet devices so that the user can read the
          site by scrolling the nav bar. Also, the sharing would be easy among
          mobile devices when the page is fully responsive, and the most
          important information is displayed to the user when the screen size is
          restricted. I have learnt a lot about responsive web design during my
          course. Using media queries, I learnt to resize the body section
          elements according to the screen sizes. Usage of chrome developer
          tools in testing the responsive design and compiling the code is very
          helpful. Moreover, I learnt to style the navbar in the form of
          hamburger menu using the CSS. In this way, a lot of space will be
          saved for mobile devices, and it also creates the user-friendly
          experience.
          <br />
          In my WEB222 course, I gained a lot of knowledge about HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript. I came across different types of tags and attributes in
          HTML which makes the skeleton of the website looks good. When it comes
          to colouring the website, I was introduced to lot about present market
          trends like Grid, Flexbox. The functioning of the website is entirely
          dependent on the JavaScript, and it is like the backend of the
          website. I got to know about basic JavaScript topics in this course
          like datatypes, arrays, objects, functions, events, conditions, DOM
          and many more. I can write, change and delete the content in html file
          by using script file of JavaScript with the DOM manipulation
          techniques. The quizzes in this subject improved my theoretical
          knowledge on the web designing. Building the web application from
          scratch in assignment 1 and 2 made my practical skills to next level.
          Overall content in the week folders, videos and examples for the code
          and ppts were very useful in my assignments. They will also be helpful
          as a handbook for my future references when I got struck at any point.
          I am looking forward to my next semesters to dive deep into the
          popular tools and frameworks like React, Bootstrap in frontend and
          Java in the backend to advance my career as a full stack developer.
